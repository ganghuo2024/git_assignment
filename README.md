a. What is an issue?

An issue is a feature or bug tracking tool used in software development. It's essentially a note on a Github repository used to communicate about improvements, tasks, or problems related to the project. Issues can be opened, assigned, and closed by contributors.

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository hosted on platforms like GitHub. It allows contributors to notify others about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository. Others can review the changes, discuss potential modifications, and finally merge the changes into the main branch if they are deemed appropriate.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?

Navigate to the repository on GitHub. Go to the "Pull Requests" tab and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Select the branch with your changes from the "Compare" dropdown menu and review your changes.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

Navigate to the repository on GitHub. Click on the "Settings" tab. In the left sidebar, click on "Collaborators.". In "Manage access", click on green "Add people" button and enter the Github username of the person you want to invite. Choose Write access level to allow the collaborator to push changes to the repository.

a. What is an issue?

An issue is a feature or bug tracking tool used in software development. It's essentially a note on a Github repository used to communicate about improvements, tasks, or problems related to the project. Issues can be opened, assigned, and closed by contributors.

b. What is a pull request?

A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository hosted on platforms like GitHub. It allows contributors to notify others about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository. Others can review the changes, discuss potential modifications, and finally merge the changes into the main branch if they are deemed appropriate.
